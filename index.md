## Please don't map Twitter

Less than 3% of tweets have location metadata <citation needed>. However, they are still a great source of information.

If users tag a place, the tweet will contain an entry, consisting of a geoJSON polygon, from Twitter&#39;s placename dictionary.&nbsp; If users share their exact location, the tweet will contain a geoJSON point.
