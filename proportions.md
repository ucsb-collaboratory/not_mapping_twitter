The Collaboratory has made several attempts to measure how few Tweets have geolocation data 
embedded in their metadata. We have found that it is consistantly less than 10%, unless one
specifically attempts to find them on purpose.

34,696 Tweets gathered during 2016 vice-presidential debate: 
- *6.27%* 2177 out of 34,696 generally located
- *0.01%* 4 exact points

70,715 Tweets from Chicago during its 2016 marathon
- *11.4%* 8,042 generally located
- *3.5%* 2,515 exact points
