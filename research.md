## Why Most Twitter Maps Can't Be Trusted
[Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/why-most-twitter-maps-can-t-be-trusted) 
Marshall, A. (2015, March 26). Why Most Twitter Maps Can't Be Trusted. Bloomberg.com. 

- "Twitter maps are less representations of deep, social phenomena and more depictions of population patterns."
- "This “points on a map” approach doesn't teach the map viewer anything about tweet density. What looks like one point on a map may actually be 14 on top of each other."
- "How do researchers adjust for spambots, which often glom onto trending Twitter topics to auto-promote their wares? What about "power users," people who obsessively tweet with the same hashtag over and over and over again?"
- "The problem with Twitter maps, then, isn’t that social media data is inherently flawed—it’s that the people who make them get lazy. “[When] you have these giant Twitter datasets …  it’s very, very easy to get that view from above and let the data speak for itself and just sort of stop there,” says Poorthuis. “That’s not the right stopping point. You need to contextualize by looking at the data in more detail—the variables and dimensions combined with the local knowledge.”"
